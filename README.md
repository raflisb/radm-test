## Color Gallery (please read it carefully)

- How it works : 
  1. i define a color hex array (on component/color)
  2. i put a color to a Row with 5 column 
  3. use filter to show only the selected color 
  

- Known bug : 
    1. after using filter color, must reset filter to all first before change to another color 


- Structure : 
    App.Js still using functional style
    Another compornent using Class style (usually i'am using class component style )

- Not yet ready : 
   - Darker Filter
